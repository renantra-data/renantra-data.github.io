## About Me
I build reliable data products and machine learning systems that help teams unlock better decisions. I enjoy working across the whole data lifecycle — from data ingestion and modeling to production-ready ML and observability.

- 🔭 Currently: Building scalable data pipelines and ML models
- 🌱 Learning: Causal inference and production ML observability
- 👯 Open to: Collaboration on data-heavy projects and open-source contributions
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love transforming messy datasets into beautiful, reproducible analyses
